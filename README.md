  Michael Flores' Personal Website
</h1>

<p>My name is Michael Flores, but I typically go by Mike. I'm a Web Developer based in Chicago, IL. </p>

<p> I've been developing software for over 6 years, and have been a part of 3 separate companies.</p> 
<p> For the most part, I've been developing in the .NET stack, but I'd say I'm fairly proficient in JavaScript as well. Not the best, but I get by :). </p>

<p> As of 2-5-2021, I'm available for work. I'm looking form a mid-senior level .NET web developer position. I've got familiarity in .NET Standard, Core, MVC, SQL, React, and much more. Please feel free to reach out if there's anything
that you have available that may work out.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this if you have, have a good one!</p>

<p>-Mike</p>
